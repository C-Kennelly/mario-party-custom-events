# mario-party-custom-events
This repository holds custom events I've written for Mario Party.
All events will be in C, for I am a mere mortal who may never understand MIPS.


# Repo Structure

## In Work
These are events I'm working on.  No guarantees they work, but I usually try to check in something that will compile.

## Complete
These events are done and can be used as templates.  They definitely work on an emulator and are intended to work on real hardware.  Submit an issue if they don't, or better yet a PR. =)
