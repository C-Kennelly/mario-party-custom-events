Upcoming plans for the Character Swap Board

Mechanic: Character Door
  - Passing event, like a skeleton key door, but it cares about which character you are.
  - Param - PreferredCharacterCategory: 0 == Plumber, 1 == Princess, 2 == Beast, 3 == Villain
    - Characters are split into 4 categories, and the approaching character will be judged against this category.
  - Param - OpenMode: Character Doors can be set in 4 modes: 0 == Matching Only, 1 == Matching with Fees, 2 == All but Matching, 3 == Dynamic
    - When in Matching Only, only characters matching the PreferredCharacterCategory may pass.  Example, only Mario and Luigi could pass a door with Plumber set.
      - Flavor message accept/reject
    - When in Matching with Fees, characters matching the PreferredCharacterCategory may pass for free, and **allied** character categories may pass for the PassingFee.
      - Flavor message accept for matching.  Fee offer accept/reject for allied characters with standard flavor accept/reject.  Flavor message Reject for enemy characters.
      - Allies are the "not enemies" category.  Plumbers and Villains are enemies.  Princesses and Beasts are enemies.
    - When in All but Matching, every character category EXCEPT the PreferredCharacterCategory may pass.  Example, Mario and Luigi would be the only characters that CANNOT pass a door with Plumber set.
        - Don't do this on the first pass.
        - When in Dynamic mode, the door lets you through no matter your character if the BoardRAM slot is 0... otherwise, uses the value of the BoardRAM to select one of the other modes.  
  - Param - PassingFee: When a character wants to pay to pass in MatchingWithFees mode, how much they need to pay.  Default, 10 coins.
  - Param - ChangeMode: Doors can be set to change their preferred character 0 == NoChange (default),  1 == Randomly, 2 == Sequence, 3 == EveryUse
    - If set to NoChange, the door is fixed for the entire game.
    - If set to Randomly, the door randomizes its PreferredCharacterCategory to anything but the current one.
    - If set to Sequence, the door changes its PreferredCharacterCategory in order (Plumbers -> Princesses -> Beasts -> Villains -> Plumbers)
      - PreferredCharacterCategory == PreferredCharacterCategory++ % 4
  - Param - ChangeModeTurns: If the door's ChangeMode is set to Randomly or Sequence, how many pass before a change.
    - All doors on map write to this value in a shared BoardRAM?
  - Do we need a BoardRAM selector PER door??
    - Need to be able to query this for AI logic on character swap
  

Set Your Character - Check on Board

    - Landing/Passing: Fee to change
    - After Turn: Every N Turns

Swap Character
  - The Swap Character event will allow players to change their active character out for another one.
  - When the event fires, it will proceed according to its [Swap Mode].  
  - Example, if Mario lands on the space, and Daisy, DK, and Yoshi are still playing:
    - [Swap Mode]: (0 - Swap Only, 1 - Steal Only, 2 - Shuffle Only, 3 - No Swap, 4 - No Steal, 5- No Shuffle, 6 - All, 7 - Forced Shuffle)
      - [Swap Only] will only let the player change to a character NOT played by another player, so Mario can only pick from Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi.
        - Needs a [You Choose] option
        - The AI ideally need to read the board index, find the closest character door in front of them, and pick a character that matches the board (or decline if one doesn't).
          - Or maybe they just pick "You Choose"
      - [Steal Only] will only let the player SWAP with another layer, so Mario could only choose to pick from Daisy, DK, and Yoshi.  When he does, he'll swap characters with that player and they will become Mario.
        - The AI ideally need to read the board index, find the closest character door in front of them, and steal a character that matches (or decline if one doesn't)
          - Or maybe just calculate the ideal character by which character door is closest to the star and ahead of it.
        - Needs a [You Choose] option
      - [Shuffle Only] randomly assigns everyone a character.  Everyone is guaranteed a new character, but not necessarily an unused one.
        - The AI should always choose shuffle, unless they are already the ideal 
      - [No Swap] The host will offer the choice between Steal or Shuffle, but not Swap
      - [No Steal] The host will offer the choice between Swap or Shuffle, but not Steal
      - [No Shuffle] The host will offer the choice between Swap or Steal, but not Shuffle
      - [All] The host will offer a choice between Swap, Steal, or Shuffle.
      - [Forced Shuffle] - the host offers no choice or fee and runs [Shuffle]
  - The event can optionally charge a fee for the actions of the player according to the [Fee Type] and in the [Fee Amount]
    - [Fee Type]: 0 - Victim Fee, 1 - Steal Fee, 2 - Shuffle Fee, 3 - All Fee, 3 - No Fee, 
        - [Victim Fee] - If stealing, the victim can choose to pay coins equal to the [Fee Amount] to block the steal.  Swapping is free, and you can't block a shuffle.  Default 10.
        - [Steal Fee] - If stealing, the player must pay coins equal to the [Fee Amount] to steal only.  Swapping is free.
        - [Shuffle Fee] - The player must pay coins equal to the [Fee Amount] to shuffle. Stealing and Swapping are free.
        - [All Fee] - The player must pay coins equal to the [Fee Amount] to do anything.
        - [No Fee] - Fee logic is skipped for both Swap and Steal
    - [Fee Amount] - The amount of coins charged according the rules of the [Fee Type].
    - [Space Logic]: 0 - Landing/Passing, 1 - End of Turn 4th Place Choice, 2 - End of Turn Random, 
    
    Need a way to limit access
    - [Place Availability]: 0 - No Restriction, 1 - 4th place only, 2 - Not 1st place
    - [Turn Availability]: 0 - No Restriction, Turn Cooldown, Turn Multiple, Last 5 Turns
    - [Turn Availability Number]:  


Bonus Star Vendor
  - The bonus star vendor dispenses a bonus star at the end of the game for meeting a particular condition outside of the standard 3 bonus stars (Coin, Minigame, Happening)
  - The condition that grants a bonus star to each is changeable mid game by passing the vendor, picking the condition, and paying them a fee.
  - Once the fee is paid, the vendor will not change the condition for the rest of the game.
  - There are 4 such vendors on the map - the fee increases on the following schedule for any remaining vendors in order to incentivize players to commit early.
    - 1st Vendor - 10 coins
    - 2nd Vendor - 15 coins
    - 3rd Vendor - 20 coins
    - 4th Vendor - 30 coins
  - The vendor should also give 10 coins when they are passed if the player who is currently winning the bonus star race is the one who is passing.
    - This is to give the player who is indexing into the bonus star a mid-game advantage for pursuing the strategy.
    - This also serves to alert the party who is currently winning the star.  (Perhaps the text should mention the winner and the condition).
  - The vendors give out the stars after the last player has gone at the last turn of the game - this prevents the stars from being exposed to Chance time.
  - In the event of a tie, each players receive a star.
    - Need custom text for variable wins (1, 2, 3, and all)
  - Vendors come in one of 4 buckets, with the following 4 events to choose from in each:
    - Fortune Guy (Plumbers)
      - Most number of Blue spaces
      - Least number of Blue spaces
